          <b>I like to creep around my home and act like a goblin.</b>
          I don't know why but I just enjoy doing this. Maybe it's my way of
          dealing with stress or something but I just do it about once every
          week. Generally I'll carry around a sack and creep around in a sort of
          crouch-walking position making goblin noises, then I'll walk around my
          house and pick up various different “trinkets” and put them in my bag
          while saying stuff like “I'll be having that” and laughing maniacally
          in my goblin voice (“trinkets” can include anything from stuff I find
          on the ground to cutlery or other utensils). The other day I was
          talking with my neighbours and they mentioned hearing weird noises
          like what I wrote about and I was just internally screaming the entire
          conversation. I'm 99% sure they don't know it's me but god that 1%
          chance is seriously weighing on my mind.

        <h3>The Man In the Glass - Peter Dale Wimbrow Sr.</h3>
        <p class="famous-words">
          When you get what you want in your struggle for self<br>
          And the world makes you king for a day<br>
          Just go to the mirror and look at yourself<br>
          And see what that man has to say.<br><br>
          For it isn't your father, or mother, or wife<br>
          Whose judgment upon you must pass<br>
          The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life<br>
          Is the one staring back from the glass<br><br>
          He's the fellow to please - never mind all the rest<br>
          For he's with you, clear to the end<br>
          And you've passed your most difficult, dangerous test<br>
          If the man in the glass is your friend.<br><br>
          You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years<br>
          And get pats on the back as you pass<br>
          But your final reward will be heartache and tears<br>
          If you've cheated the man in the glass.<br>
