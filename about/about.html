            I am an aspiring UX/UI designer currently studying
            Human Centered Design & Engineering at the University of Washington.<br>
            Upholding beliefs, views, and practices from others while affirming my own is challenging in user-centered design.<br>
            I believe cultivating different perspectives and experiences are essential for inclusive design.

          <h3>Some words to live by</h3>
          <p>
            When you get what you want in your struggle for self<br>
            And the world makes you king for a day<br>
            Just go to the mirror and look at yourself<br>
            And see what that man has to say.<br>
            <br>
            For it isn't your father, or mother, or wife<br>
            Whose judgment upon you must pass<br>
            The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life<br>
            Is the one staring back from the glass<br>
            <br>
            He's the fellow to please - never mind all the rest<br>
            For he's with you, clear to the end<br>
            And you've passed your most difficult, dangerous test<br>
            If the man in the glass is your friend.<br>
            <br>
            You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years<br>
            And get pats on the back as you pass<br>
            But your final reward will be heartache and tears<br>
            If you've cheated the man in the glass.
