          I am an aspiring UX/UI designer currently studying
          Human Centered Design & Engineering at the University of Washington.<br>
          Upholding beliefs, views, and practices from others while affirming my own is challenging in user-centered design.<br>
          I believe cultivating different perspectives and experiences are essential for inclusive design.

        <h3>Here's a great poem by Peter Dale Wimbrow Sr :)</h3>
        <p class="famous-words">
          When you get what you want in your struggle for self<br>
          And the world makes you king for a day<br>
          Just go to the mirror and look at yourself<br>
          And see what that man has to say.<br><br>
          For it isn't your father, or mother, or wife<br>
          Whose judgment upon you must pass<br>
          The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life<br>
          Is the one staring back from the glass<br><br>
          He's the fellow to please - never mind all the rest<br>
          For he's with you, clear to the end<br>
          And you've passed your most difficult, dangerous test<br>
          If the man in the glass is your friend.<br><br>
          You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years<br>
          And get pats on the back as you pass<br>
          But your final reward will be heartache and tears<br>
          If you've cheated the man in the glass.<br>
        </p>
