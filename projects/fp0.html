          <h3>FP0 - Reworking My Atari Breakout Game</h3>
          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>
            For my final project, I plan on building on my Atari Breakout game from MP3 by adding a
            backend database to store high scores and obstacles to increase overall game complexity and difficulty.
          </p>
          <h4>Envisioned interface</h4>

          <h4>Project Versions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
                Prototype: The prototype version of my game will focus on implementing the aforementioned high score feature 
                with a working "evil" paddle that blocks the user's attempt to break all the blocks. The scoreboard will
                only display the top 5 players with their respective scores, regardless of their names.
                The high scores and menu interfaces will have barebones implementations with minimal styling.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Final: The final prototype will mostly be focusing on refinements of both old and new features that
                are brought up in the prototype version, which would mean incorporating CSS styling if applicable.
                This game version will allow for unique usernames with their
                respective high scores instead of having duplicate usernames with different scores on the leaderboard.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Development Plan</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Set up Firebase and connect Firebase database to project app</li>
            <li>Implement main menu interface</li>
            <li>Implement leaderboard</li>
            <li>Finalize "evil" paddle functionality (Milestone 1: Prototype)</li>
            <br>
            <li>Improve leaderboard with unique usernames</li>
            <li>Rework main menu to reflect unique username changes to leaderboard</li>
            <li>Finalize CSS styling for interfaces and objects (Milestone 2: Final)</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Some unknowns</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Firebase documentation</li>
            <li>Incorporate "evil" paddle obstacle</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Stretch Goals</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Allow user to see past top 5 high scores in the leaderboard</li>
            <li>Allow user to manually change game settings (number of blocks, speed of "evil" paddle(s), etc.)</li>
            <li>Improve ball physics</li>
          </ul>
