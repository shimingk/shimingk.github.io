          <h3>MP2 - Creative Coding using&nbsp;<em>p5.js</em>!</h3>
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>I made a series of cool p5.js sketches that can be found&nbsp;<a href="gallery.html">here</a>!</p>
          <h5>Learning p5.js</h5>
          <p>
            p5.js was a new JavaScript library I learned about in this project.
            Because of this, I anticipated a somewhat larger learning curve than my previous projects.
            I felt that the p5.js reference page in combination with video tutorials from the Coding Train
            was not enough for me. A good portion of my learning came from working with various example sketches
            and shaving off extraneous code to highlight the main points.
          </p>
          <h4>The Development Process</h4>
          <p>
            My dedicated gallery page that displays my sketches was developed alongside with creating these sketches.
            Though this project consists of 6 different p5.js sketches that range in complexity,
            my process when working on each sketch remained pretty much the same:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Watch tutorial videos relevant to the sketch</li>
            <li>If necessary, hand sketch initial concepts on paper</li>
            <li>Find relevant example p5.js sketches for inspiration</li>
            <li>Play around with these example sketches by editing them in the p5.js web editor</li>
            <li>Cut extraneous code</li>
            <li>Add sketch to a new <code>HTML</code> file and link it to my gallery page</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Issue Deep Dive</h4>
          <p>
            One of the biggest issues I found in this project was understanding how to draw
            shapes in the coordinate system in p5. I have been accustomed to the "Cartesian coordinate system"
            so it was difficult for me to visualize where in the canvas shapes are being drawn.
            To address this issue, I had to draw my sketches and shapes out on graph paper.
          </p>

          <h4>Looking forward</h4>
          <p>
            I aim to continuing iterating on the following for this project:
            <ul>
              <li>Audio & Visual: Add keyboard input</li>
              <li>Audio: loop notes to make a song</li>
              <li>Infinite Loop: sketch out spade, club, and diamond to complement the heart</li>
              <li>Random: animate since it looks like an actual audio visualizer XD</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
